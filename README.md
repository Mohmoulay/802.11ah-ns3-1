# IEEE 802.11ah simulation module for NS-3

This repository hosts an implementation of the IEEE802.11ah (Wi-Fi HaLow) protocol for the NS-3 network simulator. It comes pre-packaged with NS-3 version 3.23 but multiple modules are updated to the latest 3.25 version to incorporate congestion control fixes for TCP traffic.
